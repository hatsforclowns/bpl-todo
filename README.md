# To Do

This is a fairly simple to-do app originally built for a technical test as part of an interview process. The role in question was for a UI/UX designer, so to this day I'm not sure of *exactly* what was expected; however, I'm quite pleased with the way it turned out so I thought it worth saving for posterity.

Simply type the name of your task and click 'Add Task' (or click Enter/Return) and it'll be added to the list. A few bonus features that I was asked to implement:

- ability to automatically assign a colour to each task
- ability to sort existing tasks by recents (default), name A-Z and colour.

## What's with the names of the initial tasks?
They're all places to eat around Shoreditch in London. I've managed to visit a few of them since I initially made this but the quest is ongoing. If you ever make it to any of the venues on the list, don't forget to mention I sent you for a 0% discount off your bill. /s
